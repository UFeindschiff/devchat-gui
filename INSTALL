#Compiling the Source code
##Linux
You'll need a compiler (I recommend clang, gcc works too), pkg-config and the header files of gtk2, libsoup, gtkspell, libnotify and libxml2. Decent distributions have them included anyway, Debian/Ubuntu/Mint-users have to install »libgtk2.0-dev libxml2-dev libsoup2.4-dev libnotify-dev libgtkspell-dev« for that. Oh, and you need python for the configuration script (works both with python 2 and 3 in recent releases).
After that, it's just plain ol' ./configure && make && make install

##Windows
You're fscked. Compiling GTK apps under Windows involves black magic, human sacrifices and mingw. Basically, you'll need the -dev packages for GTK (plus all dependencies, they're listed on the GTK homepage), gtkspell (plus enchant and whatver other dependencies that has, and actual dictionaries), libsoup (note that you'll need 2.30, which is not yet available precompiled, so you have to compile that for yourself aswell – Godspeed) and libxml2, latest stable release of each. Set up your (mingw-based) compiler and linker to use the respective directories and compile. Install to %PROGRAMFILES%\Devchat\ and done™. Or not. It's the best to contact me and ask for detailed instructions. Bring coffee and pizza. And vodka. And some virgins (...for the human sacrifice of course).

#Installing compiled stuff
##Linux
make install

##Windows
Create directories and fill as listed:
%PROGRAMFILES%-Devchat─┬─bin: dcgui.exe and all .dlls
                       │
                       ├─etc: All stuff from the \etc\-dirs from downloaded binary packages.
                       │
                       ├─lib─..: same
                       │
                       └─share: same, additionally all stuff from dcgui's share\ folder (except applications\ since it's unused in Windows)
