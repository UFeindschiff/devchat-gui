See gettext manual on how to create new and edit existing .po files.
The .pot will be updated automatically on reconfiguring with --enable-nls.

Notes:
 - All error messages are preceded by "Error ?: ", please do not translate this part, so that if someone uploads an error log I can recognize the error message without having to look up the translation. The rest of the message can and should be translated.
 - Sometimes, strings have trailing "...". This is intentional and indicates, that the items open an new menu/window/browser. Keep this indication, with whatever form of punctuation your language suggests for it.
 - Key bindings (_ inside a string) can be choosen freely, but must be consistent for each translation.
 - Replace "translator-credits" with the your name(s), this will be displayed in the "About" dialog and is intended to be individual for each language.
