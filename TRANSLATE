See gettext manual on how to create new and edit existing .po files.
The .pot will be updated automatically on reconfiguring with --enable-nls.

Notes:
 - All error messages are preceded by "Error ?: ", please do not translate this part, so that if someone uploads an error log I can recognize the error message without having to look up the translation. The rest of the message can and should be translated.
 - Sometimes, strings have trailing "...". This is intentional and indicates, that the items open an new menu/window/browser. Keep this indication, with whatever form of punctuation your language suggests for it.
